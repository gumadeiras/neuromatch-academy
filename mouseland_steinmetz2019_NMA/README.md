# steinmetz2019_NMA

This bins and align the data from [Steinmetz et al, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x) into a trial-based format. The single data file (compressed in three parts) was generated for the projects section of the Neuromatch Academy summer school. 

You will need the raw data files from [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Dataset_from_Steinmetz_et_al_2019/9598406/2), and then you can run the notebook, which relies on functions from the .py file. After generating the data file, you can directly look into the notebook example for NMA ([here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/tree/master/projects), or directly on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/projects/load_steinmetz_decisions.ipynb)) to understand the fields and how to plot. 

For any questions, please open an issue! If you are part of Neuromatch Academy, open a topic on Neurostars.
